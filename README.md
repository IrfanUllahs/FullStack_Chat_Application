# Real-Time Chat Application

A full-stack real-time chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Socket.io. This app enables users to send and receive messages instantly, manage their profiles, and interact with others in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly using Socket.io.
- **User Management**: Block and unblock users in real time.
- **Authentication**: Secure sign-in with Google authentication.
- **Profile Management**: Update user profiles, including profile images using Cloudinary.
- **Message Management**: Delete individual messages or clear all messages.
- **Dashboard**: Separate dashboards for users and admins.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (running locally or using a cloud instance)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-chat-app.git
   cd real-time-chat-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install both client-side and server-side dependencies.

   ```bash
   # For client-side
   cd client
   npm install

   # For server-side
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your environment variables. Example:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the server and client applications.

   ```bash
   # Start the server
   cd server
   npm start

   # In a new terminal, start the client
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

   By default, the client will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, and the server at `http://localhost:5000`.

5. **Socket.io Server**

   Due to pricing concerns, the Socket.io server is not deployed. For local development, the Socket.io functionality is included. Note that the relevant Socket.io code is commented out in the `master` branch. You can find the working Socket.io code in the `local` branch.

   ```bash
   # To use Socket.io locally, switch to the local branch
   git checkout local
   ```

## Deployment

Currently, the Socket.io server is not deployed. For a live demo, you will need to deploy the Socket.io server separately or use local development as described above.
